Feature: Joiner analytics - Verify File source data transfer using Joiner analytics
  @GCS_SOURCE_TEST @GCS_SOURCE_JOINER_TEST @GCS_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from File source to File sink plugin successfully with Joiner
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Select plugin: "GCS" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Select plugin: "GCS" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    Then Move plugins: "GCS2" by xOffset 0 and yOffset 200
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Analytics"
    When Select plugin: "Joiner" from the plugins list as: "Analytics"
    Then Connect plugins: "GCS" and "Joiner" to establish connection
    Then Connect plugins: "GCS2" and "Joiner" to establish connection
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "GCS" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "Joiner" and "GCS3" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "GCS"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "firstName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "gcsSourceBucket1"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "format" with option value: "csv"
    Then Click plugin property: "skipHeader"
    Then Click plugin property: "enableQuotedValues"
    Then Click on the Get Schema button
    Then Verify the Output Schema matches the Expected Schema: "firstNameOutputSchema"
    Then Validate "GCS" plugin properties

    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "GCS2"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "lastName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "gcsSourceBucket2"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "format" with option value: "csv"
    Then Click plugin property: "skipHeader"
    Then Click plugin property: "enableQuotedValues"
    Then Click on the Get Schema button

    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "Joiner"
    Then Expand fields
    Then Uncheck plugin "GCS2" field "id" alias checkbox
    Then Select joiner type "Inner"
    Then Enter numPartitions "expectedJoinerOutputPartitions"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "inputsToLoadMemory" with option value: "GCS"
    Then Scroll to validation button and click
    Then Validate "Joiner" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "GCS3"
